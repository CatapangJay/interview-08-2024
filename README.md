## Home Test ##

Dear candidate,

Thank you for taking the SwiftId home test.

At SwiftId we often need to retrieve data from different sources and make that data available in our APIs.

One of those is the ASX listed companies. The list of companies is available online as a CSV here: https://www.asx.com.au/asx/research/ASXListedCompanies.csv. 
That list is updated once a day.

For this test, we have an very light skeleton API project with one endpoint. That endpoint gets an ASX listed company by its ASX code.

The goal of this test is to update the project solution etc... so it's in your opinion production ready.

We'll be looking for resiliency, efficiency, architecture etc...

Feel free to add / change anything you'd like.

Please submit your changes as a pull request.

All the best!
